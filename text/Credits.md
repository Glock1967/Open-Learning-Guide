**KAPITAL VIRTUAL ACADEMY**
is a Juba based grass-roots film, art, design, and entertainment training initiative. The Virtual Academy is a key activity of the KAPITAL Movie collective, an independent group of young designers, filmmakers, IT professionals and artists. Tapping the hopes, aspirations and dedication to create a new future beyond conflict they have come together to address the acute post- independence social, political, educational and environmental challenges arising from decades of civil war, with an urgent need to pro-actively strengthen and amplify the voice of youth seeking to eradicate the senseless violence that has gripped the country from within.

**icebauhaus** is the German partner in the international icehubs-network of green-tech & social innovation hubs, geared towards a bottom-up strategy that combines both local and international trends with state-of-the-art technological developments. icebauhaus’ work is primarily project-based and community oriented. The members are experts in various academic disciplines, entrepreneurs and generalists with a great deal of background experience in international cooperation. Main expertise and experiences: ICT in agriculture [ICT4ag], experimental building & low-cost housing, techhubs, maker spaces and innovation networks.

**r0g_agency for open culture and critical transformation** focuses on actual practice and projects embedded in communities. Its network aims to influence policy from the ground up, to inform and create better policy outcomes, extend networks and support – bringing together arts, culture, open development, civil society and transparence. r0g_agency’s work taps into the power and breadth of contemporary free and public domain resources including open educational resources [OERs], free open source software [FOSS] and hardware, open data and open knowledge repositories.
